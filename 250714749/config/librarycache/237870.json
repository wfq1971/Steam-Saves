During its landing sequence, something appears in front of the massive ship that causes it to lose control and crash into the planet. Some of the colonists survive in lifeboats, but what they find is an unforgiving land filled with creatures ready to outlast the visitors from Earth. Now the survivors must explorer, gather, build, create, fight, and ultimately, build a new home. \r\n\r\n[h2][b]Game Modes[/b][/h2]\r\n\r\nPlanet Explorers right now only features single player. \r\n\r\nIn single player there are 3 distinct selections \r\n\r\n[list][*][b]Story Mode[/b] – Story mode is the main meat and bones of the game, it is the action-adventure-rpg-somewhat-4X segment, offering npcs, missions, colony building, farming, training, diplomacy, and of course, a storyline that you can follow or ignore. This story features a 17X8km world map with many unique character, landscapes, biomes, locations, and over 140 types of potential enemies. Even though we’ve made it seem like a very action oriented game in the trailers, in reality, players can choose to not fight so much as to just plant a farm, make some food, keep the colonists alive, negotiate with the sentient aliens, and defend the perimeter from the local life forms. That can still eventually arrive at the ending. And yes, there is an ending. Story mode also features coop with other players.\r\n\r\n[*][b]Adventure Mode[/b] – This mode is based on a procedural map generated from a seed. It comes in a 40X40 kilometer map. Players will be able to complete random missions, defeat bosses, dive through dungeons, and explore different landscapes. This mode also features survival and versus.\r\n\r\n[*][b]Build Mode[/b] – In this mode, there are no enemies and an infinite amount of building material. It also currently comes in a 40X40km map. Players will be able to build whatever they want in this mode, including everything in the Creations Editor. Think of this as the perfect testing ground to test everything you build. Or…it’s your place to build your garden without ever worrying about the pesky aliens.[/list]\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][h2]Game Features[/h2][/b]\r\n[b]Current[/b]\r\n\r\n[list][*]30+ hours of storyline\r\n[*]140+ types of enemies\r\n[*]40+ unique mainline NPCs\r\n[*]Able to dig\r\n[*]Able to build\r\n[*]Able to plant farm\r\n[*]Able to build colony\r\n[*]Able to have followers\r\n[*]Creation Editor to create vehicles, weapons, objects, vtols, boats, armor, and more\r\n[*]Day/night cycle with realistic moon cycles\r\n[*]Weather system\r\n[*]15+ types of mineral types\r\n[*]200+ unique items\r\n[*]Resource scanner\r\n[*]Realtime AI pathfinding\r\n[*]Realtime water physics\r\n[*]Multiple boss types\r\n[*]Story Editor\r\n[*]AI robot follower\r\n[*]Negotiation with aliens\r\n[*]War with aliens\r\n[/list]","strSnippet":"Planet Explorers is an open world sandbox adventure RPG game set on a distant planet.
