Do you want to measure your skills against other players in a virtual economy? Do you want to own a production, retail or research company which pays out the best? It all depends on the current conditions in the virtual economy and how skillful you are in spotting business opportunities.[/p][p] \r\n[b]Sim Companies[/b] is an extremely [i]versatile[/i] browser game that allows you to experiment with various resources and test your skills against other players in the game. Sim Companies is a business simulation strategy game aimed at giving you the fun and experience of managing a company using real world economic principles. The goal of the game is to create a profitable and competitive business.[/p][p][/p][p] [/p][p][img]https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2253720/extras/Item-Collection.gif?t=1745322633[/img][/p][p]Each player receives a starting capital and few assets. Players' day-to-day tasks consist of managing the resource supply chain, from production to selling in retail, procuring business partners, ensuring financing, etc. For players to prosper, they would have to be able to read market conditions and take some trading shortcuts here and there, maybe buy their input resources on market cheaper than if they produced them or sell them on the market with higher profit than in the retail.

We thought about what makes company management fun and what makes it tedious. Sim companies' philosophy is to let you take the interesting decisions while building your own business without having to fill in tons of extra settings. We do not want to simulate the real world with all its law and other restrictions, but rather give players the freedom to make decisions that can impact their company finances and value.[/p]","strSnippet":"Become a Business Tycoon.
