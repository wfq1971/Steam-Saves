It also allows uploading images, text or other types of files to over 80 supported destinations you can choose from.\r\n\r\nShareX supports many ways to capture or record your screen.

These are called &quot;Workflows&quot;. Workflows allow each hotkey to have its own after capture tasks, after upload tasks, destination etc. For example, you can set your screen recording hotkey to upload to a specific destination, bypassing the default destination. This way, only videos will be uploaded to this configured file destination.","strSnippet":"ShareX is a free and open source program that can capture or record selected area from the screen with a single keypress, automatically save them to your hard disk/clipboard, and instantly upload them to an image/file hosting service and then can copy the URL to your clipboard."}}],["achievementmap",{"version":5,"data":"[]"}],["usernews",{"version":5,"data":[]}],["gameactivity",{"version":5,"data":[]}]]
