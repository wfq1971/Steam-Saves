[/b]\r\n\r\nSpend your afternoon dogfighting in fighter jets, before winding down in a treehouse that exists floating in a nebula. Make a new best friend while exploring a haunted mansion, right before playing a hand of cards with a robot, alien, and eight-foot tall wolf.\r\n\r\nIn VRChat, there are hundreds of thousands of worlds, millions of avatars – [i]all created by the users[/i]. No matter what you’re into, there’s a space in VRChat for you. And if there isn’t, we’ll give you the tools to make your dream a reality.\r\n\r\nWhile not required to join in on the fun, VRChat was built to take advantage of VR headsets in many unique ways. That means avatars that flow with your movement, and systems that work alongside various hardware platforms to provide full-body tracking, finger tracking, and much, much more.\r\n\r\nThere’s something magical around every corner. Come take a look, and see what you find.\r\n\r\n[img]https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/438100/extras/01_MeetNewFriends.gif?t=1733413042[/img]\r\n\r\nIn VRChat, there’s always something to do – and people to meet there.\r\n\r\nVisit a planetarium and have a chat about astronomy. Go on a virtual hike through a majestic fantasy forest. Pull up to a car meet, and talk shop with some gearheads. Attend a live music event underneath a chemical storage facility, and talk obscure genres with DJs. Once you find your crowd, join their Group, and you'll be able to find them again the next time you're on.\r\n\r\nYour community – [i]whatever it is[/i] – is here.\r\n\r\n[img]https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/438100/extras/02_GoOnAnAdventure.gif?t=1733413042[/img]\r\n\r\nThere are thousands of games to play in VRChat. Try running a kitchen in a busy restaurant, or racing go-karts in zero gravity. Fancy a battle royale? We’ve got those, too -- just probably with a wider diversity of avatars than you’ve ever seen before.\r\n\r\nIt doesn’t matter what you like to play: casual card games, shooters, racing, platformers, puzzles, horror, and of course, endless party games. If you want to play it, it probably exists here (and if it doesn't, you can build it yourself).\r\n\r\n[img]https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/438100/extras/03_BuildYourDreams.gif?t=1733413042[/img]\r\n\r\nEverything here was built by the community using the VRChat SDK. Combined with Unity and Udon, our in-house scripting language, we give our users as much power as possible to build whatever their imaginations can conjure up.\r\n\r\n[b]But creation isn’t just limited to worlds.[/b]\r\n\r\nVRChat provides a level of creative freedom that is unmatched anywhere else, and nowhere is that reflected best than on the avatars of our users. In VRChat, you can be anything, and explore your identity however you’d like. Want to be an alien? A talking dog? A sentient shoe with glowing bits that react to the beat of music by changing color? \r\n\r\nI mean, sure, if that’s what you’re about.\r\n\r\n[b]Come on in -- hundreds of thousands of worlds (and a whole bunch of new friends!) are waiting for you.[/b]","strSnippet":"Join our growing community as you explore, play, and help craft the future of social VR. Create worlds and custom avatars. Welcome to VRChat."}}]]
