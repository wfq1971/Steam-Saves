Plant the correct crops in the right areas, manage many different fields in parallel and watch your income increase.[/p][h2]Buy and care for livestock[/h2][p]Construct barns and sheds for 3 types of farm animals. Assign fields as pastures and make sure that your animals stay fed during all seasons and temperatures by moving them between the green grasslands and your warm farm. In return, they will reward you with profitable milk, wool and eggs.
